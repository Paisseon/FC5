# The Only Compendium You'll Ever Need
The best D&D 5e compendium for Fight Club 5. This contains PHB, DMG, VGtM, XGtE, MtoF, SCAG, CoS, OotA, SKT, PotA, ToA, RoT, HotDQ, TftYP, EEPC, WGtE, DH, and DiA.
All data is taken from PDFs provided by DnD-Repository and OCR. A simple AI formatted everything into FC5XML. There might be mistakes from OCR, I didn't do any corrections.

Obviously this requires Fight Club 5.
